## HopeKCC Summer Intern 2024

Welcome to the HopeKCC Summer Intern 2024 GitHub repository! This repository is for all students to submit their weekly code examples and presentation slides. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure your work is organized and accessible.

### Repository Structure

The repository is structured to keep each student's work categorized and organized within their respective team folders. Each student will have their own subfolder under their team's directory.
```
summer-intern-2024/
│
└── team/
    ├── team-aa/
    │   ├── student1/
    │   └── student2/
    └── team-os/
        ├── student7/
        └── student8/
```

### Submission Guidelines

1. **Create Your Folder:** Each student should create a folder under their respective team directory named after their GitHub username or full name.

   Example: `team/team-aa/student1`

2. **Weekly Submissions:** Submit your weekly code examples and presentation slides into your folder. Each submission should be organized by week.

   Example:
   ```
   team/team-aa/student1/
   ├── week1/
   │   ├── code/
   │   └── presentation/
   ├── week2/
   │   ├── code/
   │   └── presentation/
   ```
3. **File Naming:** Use descriptive names for your files to make it easier to identify your work. Submit your presentation slides in PDF format only.

4. **Commit Messages:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages for your submissions. This helps mentors and fellow students understand the changes made.

5. **File Size Limit:** Ensure that each file is no larger than 5 MB. If you need to upload larger files, consider splitting them into smaller parts or using external storage solutions and linking to them in your submission.
